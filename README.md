- 👋 Hi, I’m @DylanHPrograms
- Hi everyone, My name is Dylan Hewitt and I am an aspiring programmer/developer.  Ive been programming for about 2 months now and have realized the potential I have in this field to do work that really matters to me.
- Since I was young I've always been interested in technology and how it works.  I find coding to be fascinating and challenging and the fact that is in such high demand currently is what motivates me to learn as much as I can.
- Currently I'm learning C# development to get a baseline skillset and then branch out from there!  I am an avid learner and push myself to take on challenging projects and concepts, but I also want to learn from others and get 
  to know how the industry works.  Feel free to shoot me messages and invites to projects and stop by to give advice on my code!
